autologin <username> <password>

connect <host> <port>

	Disconnect any existing connection and connect to the specified host and port numbers.

delay <time_ms>

	Delays execution by the spcified timeout value.

echo <text>

	Echos the text to the log. All manipulations mentioned under send apply.

quit

receive <pattern>

	Receive lines of text until the pattern is matched.
	If ZTELNET_CRLF_REPLACE_IN_SCRIPT is set, any occurrent of this string
		in <pattern> is replaced by a CRLF.
	If ZTELNET_AUTO_CRLF is true, automatically append CRLF to <pattern>.
	If the capture group "echo" is matched, it defines the part of the text
		that will be echoed as output.
	The entire match text is available for later commands to process.
	
	Example:
	
		receive (?<echo>\d\d\d)\x20.*
		
		Wait until you get a line of text that begins with a three-letter numeric code,
		and has at least one space, and print that code only.

send <text>

	Sends text through the connection.
	If ZTELNET_AUTO_CRLF is true, automatically append CRLF to <text>.
	If ZTELNET_CRLF_REPLACE_IN_SCRIPT is set, any occurrence of this string
		in <text> is replaced by a CRLF.
	If ZTELNET_EMPTY_REPLACE_IN_SCRIPT is set, any occurrence of this string
		in <text> is replaced by an empty string. This is useful mainly
		when you want to send whitespace, for example:
			send |   123
		will send three space characters followed by "123".
	If ZTELNET_EXPAND_ENVIRONMENT_STRINGS_IN_SCRIPT is true,
		any occurence of an environment variable name in <text> is replaced
		by its value. In addition, the following pseudo variables are defined:
			
			%ZTELNET_SCRIPT_NAME% is the file name of the current script
			
	Example:
		
		send Subject: %ZTELNET_SCRIPT_NAME%
		
		Send a mail "subject" line that contains the name of the script.

sendfile <filename>

	The file is sent as-is, with no translation done on it.

setoption <optionname>=<optionvalue>

	Options which are not set using the setoption command are retrieved from the
		environment variable of the same name. If no such variable is defined,
		a default value is used.
